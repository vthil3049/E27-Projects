				<p>Neha is a talented dancer  who showed a lot of promise and deep interest in dance from a very young age.  She was exposed to the beautiful and intense art form of Bharata Natyam from a tender age of 7.  Her love for this art, persuaded her to take up professional training in Bharata Natyam from <a href="http://www.nalandadanceeducation.com/">Nalanda Nritya Kala Mahavidhyalaya (Nalanda College of Classical Dance)</a> in Mumbai, India.<br /><br />
					This internationally famous institution was founded by Padmashri Dr. Kanak Rele.
