							<p>Neha founded the academy in early 2005. Here she inspires all her students to strive for perfection and the individual focused training brings out the best in them. She is very popular in the Nashua area for her authentic style of teaching and uncompromising discipline that helps her students reach the highest standards in dance.</p>
							<p>While she specializes in teaching <span class="text-info">Bharatanatyam</span> and <span class="text-info">Mohiniattam</span> she is very knowledgeable and adept with the Folk dances of India. She also teaches the popular <span class="text-info">Bollywood</span> style dances.</p>
							<p>Her students are primarily in the school age range, but she also enjoys teaching the classical and Bollywood style dances to adults. <br />
								She has trained and choreographed many performances for her students for dance festivals, dance competitions, fund raising events all around the New England area and some of her students have also performed in India as well. Her students won various dance competitions in the New England area.</p>
								<p>Following the Guru-Shishya traditions in teaching, she interacts with students in trying to get the best out of every student. It is to her credit that five of her students have performed their 'Arangetram' or solo dance debut recitals since 2006 and more are on their way to achieving this milestone.</p>
